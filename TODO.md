TODO List:

List of outstanding todo items from PR feedback that could
not be completed or wish list items. 

Remind of tasks that need to be addressed.

1) Conflict between functions and Python internal functions.
   Perl legacy code used type() and current code uses file.
   These should be easy to eliminate once PRs are closed.

2) Improve documentation. Develop own template for providing
   useful documentation.

3) Rename awkward file names. Reorganize code files.
   arXiv directory/package name should be changes. This contains
   support routines from legacy system.
   utilities - contains other helper routines.

   Need to clean up naming and where these files live.
